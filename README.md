# MultiThreading 
# 🧵 Single-threading vs Multithreading in Java with Thread Pool & JMeter Testing

## 📌 Project Overview

This Java mini-project demonstrates different ways to execute tasks:

1. **Single-threading** – Tasks are executed one after another on the main thread.
2. **Multithreading** – Multiple threads handle tasks concurrently using the `Thread` class.
3. **Thread Pool** – A fixed set of reusable threads using `ExecutorService` (from Java's `concurrent` package).
4. **JMeter Load Testing** – Test how your Java application performs under simulated user load.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Java SE 8+**
- **JDK** for compilation and running
- **Apache JMeter** for load testing
-**vs code** as code editor

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept          | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single-threading | Executes all tasks sequentially on the main thread                          |
| Multithreading   | Uses `Thread` or `Runnable` to run multiple tasks in parallel               |
| Thread Pool      | Uses `ExecutorService` to efficiently manage a fixed number of threads      |
| Load Testing     | Simulates concurrent users using JMeter to analyze performance              |
